            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
            <li> describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
            <li><p class="strike">Css is not neccesary</p><p class="back">CSS saves a lot of work.</p>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
            <li><p class="under">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</p></li>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <div class="color font">
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li class="stret">The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <p class="back">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </p>because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="color para">
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

        <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class ad ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
